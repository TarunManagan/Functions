# Functions
A function is a set of statements that takes input, does some specific computation, and produces output. 
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again 
for different inputs, we can call this function.
In simple terms, a function is a block of code that runs only when it is called.
* Functions help us in reducing code redundancy. We create a function and call it everywhere. This also helps in maintenance as we have to make changes in only one place if we make changes to the functionality in the future.
* Functions make code modular. Consider a big file having many lines of code. It becomes really simple to read and use the code  if the code is divided into functions.
* Functions provide abstraction. For example, we can use library functions without worrying about their internal work.

# There are two most popular ways to pass parameters:

* Pass by Value: In this parameter passing method, values of actual parameters are copied to the functionâ€™s formal parameters. The actual and formal parameters are stored in different memory locations so any changes made in the functions are not reflected in the actual parameters of the caller. 
 
* Pass by Reference: Both actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations, so any changes made inside the function are reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.

# Syntax: 
void myFunction() { // declaration
  // the body of the function (definition)
}
